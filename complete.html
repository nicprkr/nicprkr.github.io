                        <h2>The Project</h2>
                        <p>Traction Complete is a complex data management tool that had a sad marketing website languishing on Wix, unloved and unmaintained. We had three months to re-design the site, update the branding and copy, and develop a custom Wordpress theme. The final result ended up:
                            <ul>
                                <li>- improving page speed by over 4 seconds</li>
                                <li>- ranked for search terms within two weeks</li>
                                <li>- gave the team a flexible brand style to reuse</li>
                                <li>- gave the team access to more robust & flexible CMS</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                        <h2>Implementation</h2>
                        <p>I developed the theme using <a href="https://understrap.com/">Understrap</a>, a Wordpress framework that incorporates Underscore and Bootstrap 4. Since the turnaround time was quick, I wanted to use the built-in icon library, Wordpress template files, and reponsive layout included in the theme. I also used a particle library to give the homepage a little something special. </p>

                        <p>Blah blah blah.</p>
                        <p>Text decorations are drawn across descendant text elements. This means that if an element specifies a text decoration, then a child element can't remove the decoration. For example, in the markup <p>This text has <em>some emphasized words</em> in it.</p>, the style rule p { text-decoration: underline; } would cause the entire paragraph to be underlined. The style rule em { text-decoration: none; } would not cause any change; the entire paragraph would still be underlined. However, the rule em { text-decoration: overline; } would cause a second decoration to appear on "some emphasized words".</p>
